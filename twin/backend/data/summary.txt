I am a Software Developer with 5.6 years of experience in MERN Stack and AI Engineering.
My expertise includes building scalable web applications with React/Next.js, developing robust APIs with Node.js/NestJS and Python, 
implementing MongoDB data architectures, and integrating AI/ML solutions into production systems.
Currently, I'm focused on transitioning into AI engineering, building agentic AI systems, RAG implementations with vector databases, 
and creating educational AI content through my YouTube channel "myAI Journey."
My background includes developing enterprise applications at Excellence Driving School and e-Zest Solutions, 
completing The School of AI's Agentic AI Engineering program, and building AI-powered chrome extensions and multi-agent architectures.
Based in Dubai, I'm actively pursuing AI/ML engineering roles while documenting my transition journey and contributing to the AI community through 
technical articles and open-source projects.
I have deployed a saas application for medical consultation and follows up emails in AWS app runner.
